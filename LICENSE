CHOOSING A LICENSE
================================================================================

- MIT LICENSE: Perfect for open source projects, most popular, corporate-friendly
- APACHE 2.0: Similar to MIT, includes explicit patent grants, also corporate-friendly
- BSD 3-CLAUSE: Slightly more restrictive than MIT, good for BSD ecosystem projects
- ISC LICENSE: Minimal and clean, functionally equivalent to MIT

All licenses are permissive (non-copyleft) and allow commercial and private use.

For this project, we recommend using the MIT LICENSE as the primary license.
