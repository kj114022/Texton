Texton is an open-source application for downloading and converting EBooks.

Features:

* Search for your favorite titles and download them
* Can't find your favorite book in the right format? No problem, builtin EBook
  converter

Download sources:

Texton uses the following download sources:

* Libgen (https://libgen.li/) which is considered non-free for being a shadow library

Ebook conversion sources:

* Texton API (https://pantheon.up.railway.app) which is a proprietary custom-made source

I will consider open-sourcing the Texton API once its mature enough.
